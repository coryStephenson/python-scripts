# I did not write any of the scripts in this directory!!!

These scripts were provided to me as part of a specialization on Coursera called Advanced Python for Cybersecurity. 

The instructor was [Howard Poston](https://github.com/hposton) of the Infosec Institute. 

The repository associated with this specialization can be found here: [Advanced Python for Cybersecurity repo](https://github.com/hposton/advanced-python-for-cybersecurity.git)

However, I did not take this course. I just wanted wanted the scripts for future reference.
